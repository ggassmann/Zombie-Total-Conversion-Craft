A couple quick tips for modelling with blender.

Ctrl-J joins objects. Models must be one object.

Ctrl-T in edit mode converts all polygons to triangles. All polygons must be triangles

Alt-J in edit mode attempts to create quads, useful for restoring after converting to triangles, though not perfect

If some faces are missing, Ctrl-N will attempt to autocorrect normals. Otherwise use w -> Flip Normals to manually fix each face

If a model still doesn't load after joining and converting to triangles, remove all lines that start with 'o'
